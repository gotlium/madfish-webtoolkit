## RatioProxy ##
RatioProxy allows you to bypass statistics in private torrent trackers. It acts as a proxy between your torrent client and the tracker, replacing actual download/upload values with another ones.

This program can be useful to people, who can't seed (small upload speed, or traffic limitations). If you can seed, please don't use this program - this will break the idea behind the BitTorrent protocol.
